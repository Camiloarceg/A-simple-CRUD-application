# 🛠️ Simple Spring Boot CRUD Application

This is a basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **H2 in-memory database**. It features a RESTful API to manage a simple entity, demonstrating how to set up and interact with a Spring Boot backend.

> 🔨 This project is based on the tutorial: _"CRUD App in 30 mins | Simplest Explanation | Spring Boot | REST | JPA | H2"_  
> 🧠 I used the video as a learning reference and then customized the implementation to solidify my understanding and improve my backend development skills.
